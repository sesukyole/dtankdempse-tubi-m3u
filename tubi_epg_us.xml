First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250119060000 +0000" stop="20250119070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots.

British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250119070000 +0000" stop="20250119080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E02 - Episode 2</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250119080000 +0000" stop="20250119090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E03 - Episode 3</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250119090000 +0000" stop="20250119100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119085300 +0000" stop="20250119095300 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>He arrives at Brixton Prison in south London packed with drug dealers, burglars, muggers and thieves - some very unsavoury characters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119095300 +0000" stop="20250119105300 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>Gordon has chosen his Bad Boys Brigade to work for his prison business, and now he has to trust the prisoners with sharp knives if they're to be able to cook on the inside and sell on the outside.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119105300 +0000" stop="20250119115300 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>Gordon's been at Brixton Prison for two months and it's time his Bad Boy Bakery business started bringing in some proper money.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119115300 +0000" stop="20250119125300 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>Gordon's served almost six months in Brixton Prison, but it will mean nothing if he doesn't leave a viable business behind to keep prisoners working and earning.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119125300 +0000" stop="20250119135200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119135200 +0000" stop="20250119145400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119145400 +0000" stop="20250119152300 +0000"><title>Lazy Boy Garage</title><desc>Three best friends engage in the world of international car flipping; the boys are on the hunt for Range Rovers that can turn a profit.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119152300 +0000" stop="20250119155200 +0000"><title>Lazy Boy Garage</title><desc>Jonny Smith finds a two-door Ford Escort at an estate in Austria, but Tim Glover's worst fears are confirmed when it arrives.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119155200 +0000" stop="20250119162100 +0000"><title>Lazy Boy Garage</title><desc>The Lazy Boys track down a rare and well-preserved Opel Kadett to turn into a rally car, but have to change their plans when the car arrives from Spain.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119162100 +0000" stop="20250119165200 +0000"><title>Lazy Boy Garage</title><desc>Tim Glover finds a rare two-door Toyota Carina, as the Lazy Boys try to move into the Japanese retro car scene.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119165200 +0000" stop="20250119172300 +0000"><title>Lazy Boy Garage</title><desc>Tom Ford sets his heart on a Ford Fiesta Mk1 from Spain.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119172300 +0000" stop="20250119175300 +0000"><title>Lazy Boy Garage</title><desc>Tom Ford thinks sourcing a cool retro van that someone can use to sell coffee in is a no-brainer, and the boys find a Renault 4F6.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250119175300 +0000" stop="20250119185100 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Both choppers are called to a head-on road smash in the Yorkshire Dales that’s left two pensioners trapped in their wrecked car.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250120015500 +0000" stop="20250120025700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250120025700 +0000" stop="20250120035900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>When 21 year old chef Tim sold "fine dining" to Bonapartes bistro, they assumed he could cook.
