Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250127174000 +0000" stop="20250127193400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence. Yet the body of the mother of a deceased, one-time carnival queen, found in a stream, looks set to spoil things, as Barnaby and Jones find themselves digging up the past. From familiar faces, to drunken boasts and hidden obessions, it slowly becomes clear that the mother's daughter might be the key to solving the murder, when more deaths follow.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250127193400 +0000" stop="20250127212200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Wealthy, eccentric and obese aristocrat Freddy Butler drops dead, shortly after gathering all three of his wives at Haddington Hall to make an announcement. Although George Bullard is adamant his death is from natural causes, the case is far from simple when Freddy's solicitor is deliberately killed in a house fire shortly afterwards and Freddy's will goes missing. Barnaby and Jones find themselves investigating the extended Butler family, uncovering hidden secrets, illegitimate children and elusive treasure in the process.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250127212200 +0000" stop="20250127230900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Martin Barrett, a local council clerk living in Midsomer Worthy, is murdered during the night by shotgun, prompting Barnaby and Jones to find a motive for his murder. When they discover that Barrett was an expert blackmailer, his victims become prime suspects for his death - from a local pub landlord, a cleaner, a prominent member of the police board, to a former marine geologist. As they investigate, finding themselves drawn to the seaside, they slowly uncover deception, theft, attempted blackmail and hatred.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250127230900 +0000" stop="20250128005600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the village of Broughton, a ninety-year-old battle of the sexes has often occurred, with men trying to oppose an event that the women have managed to successfully hold without interruption, until it culminates with casualties on both sides - Mildred Danvers, an elderly woman who had returned on the day of a funeral and poisoned in her hotel room, and Rev. Anthony Gant, shot during a major event being held in the village green, in view of many. It soon becomes clear someone may have wished to kill both to cover up a dark truth, and soon Barnaby has to figure out who amongst the village wanted both dead, complicated further when Gant's curate is murdered next.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/NPELiZm8y5DsEA==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjZAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20250126013600 +0000" stop="20250126023200 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Bombas por Correo, Actualización: La Maldición Genética de Mamá, El Amor Perdido de Loving &amp; Actualización, Pregúntale a Alice.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126023200 +0000" stop="20250126033300 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Asesinato en Fiesta de Navidad, Actualización: Fraude Nudista, Fraude Gitano, Dólares de Drummond &amp; Actualización y Recuperación de Coma.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126033300 +0000" stop="20250126043200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Dead Ringer; Woody's Millions; Plummer's Booty; Jim and Tammi.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126043200 +0000" stop="20250126052600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: La Última Carrera de Larry &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Hasta Que La Muerte Nos Separe, Asesinato de Millonarios &amp; Actualización y Bailes con Moomess.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126052600 +0000" stop="20250126062300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Battling for Her Brother &amp; UD, UD: Johnny Lee Wilson, Kempton's Search &amp; UD, Missing Bonnie &amp; UD and Devil's Backbone.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126062300 +0000" stop="20250126072100 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>An exploration of Bigfoot II, threats and harassment, murder by arson, and more.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126072100 +0000" stop="20250126081800 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Two Mary Morris Murders; Lenny Dirickson; Fatal Flowers and update; Boston Healer.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126081800 +0000" stop="20250126091100 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Bordeaux Murder, Salsa Swindlers and update; Hotel Balcony Death update; Amber Swartz and update; Poison Snake update.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126091100 +0000" stop="20250126100700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Jesse James Hollywood and update; Rider Down and update; Bad Dad; Picture Kristen Gone.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126100700 +0000" stop="20250126110500 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Missing Rock Star &amp; UD, UD: Wandering Fishman, St. Louis Custody Killing &amp; UD, Animal Therapist, Who Do Voodoo? and Molnar Heir &amp; UD.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126110500 +0000" stop="20250126120200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Socorro Close Encounter, UD: Car Crash Thank You, Kentucky Visions, Foster Twins &amp; UD and Elevator Murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126120200 +0000" stop="20250126125700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Burning Bed; Freshwater Runs Still and update; Starfyre Fugitive and update; Vanished in the Heartland and update; Sweet Sue update.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250126125700 +0000" stop="20250126135700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Brandon Lee, Missing Anchorwoman, First Love, Second Chance &amp; UD, Killer Castro and Gulf P.O.W.

Barnaby and Jones discover that the victim was poisoned with a rare toxin extracted from Ecuadorean poison frogs - so the hunt is on for a particularly ruthless and imaginative killer. The detectives soon learn that a feud is raging between local occult practitioner Ernest Balliol and famous writer Aloysius Wilmington. While some of the villagers - such as Ernest's daughter Isolde - believe that powerful magical forces are at play, others think the reasons for the bloodshed may have their roots in the distant past. Barnaby and Jones soon find themselves delving into the occult, magic, and ancients books of power, to determine what happened, and soon sense a mixture of both might be the motive for the murder, when a book shop owner is killed with shattered glass, laced in the same poison.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250126090000 +0000" stop="20250126110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are forced to take part in a team building exercise and Tom has plenty of problems dealing with the young, new, acting Chief Superintendent, John Cotton (Nick Fletcher). Following an explosion in a truck that had been stored in a truck depot, a body is soon discovered in a nearby lake, which turns out to be Alec Grainger, who had been seen arguing with James Parkes (Joseph Millson), the son of Colonel Matt Parkes (Tim Pigott-Smith). James appears to be involved in shady business deals and is blamed by his grandmother Caroline Halsey (Judy Parfitt) - and others - for the suicide of a woman he got pregnant two years before. Barnaby and Jones find themselves delving into a mixture of fraud, smuggling, and lies, trying to piece together the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250126110000 +0000"
