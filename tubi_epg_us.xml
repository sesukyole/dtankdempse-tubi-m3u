Soon after, he hears the sound of the hunt begin and the unforgettable noise of the horses and hounds in hot pursuit of the fox.  Running for cover, towards the safety of his home-made shelter, he stumbles and falls into a pit - screaming. LIZA, isolated in the disused railway carriage which constitutes her home, moves deeper into the wood having heard the scream.  She finds the pit and sees the tramp lying crumpled on the ground, clearly dead.  She stares at him for a moment, then turns and walks away.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250124052600 +0000" stop="20250124072500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The double murder of eccentric widow, Isobel Hewitt, and adulterous doctor, Duncan Goff, lead Barnaby and Troy into finding out more about their personal and private lives in the village of Malham Bridge.

While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret.
