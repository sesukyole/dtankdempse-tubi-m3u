This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars.

His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".
