He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110062700 +0000" stop="20250110072400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110072400 +0000" stop="20250110082300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Ladies' man Ash needs help covering an embarrassing portrait of his beloved mum.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110082300 +0000" stop="20250110092200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110092200 +0000" stop="20250110102100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110102100 +0000" stop="20250110111800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110111800 +0000" stop="20250110121300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110121300 +0000" stop="20250110130800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The artists cover Zoe's tattoo dedicated to her favourite food, Sean's lewd and lengthy leprechaun that his wife wants rid of.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110130800 +0000" stop="20250110140900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110140900 +0000" stop="20250110150800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110150800 +0000" stop="20250110160900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.

The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.
