After a tough stretch hunting in Mississippi, the crew heads back down to Florida to try to get some momentum going again. After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up.

Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250116052200 +0000" stop="20250116070900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are in Dunstan to investigate the deaths of a reclusive couple.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250116185300 +0000" stop="20250116195600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad. La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250116195600 +0000" stop="20250116205500 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team removes a broken-down tractor from a Caravan Park in trouble with the law; Luke responds to a boat owner in desperate need of help.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250116205500 +0000" stop="20250116215300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Extreme Salvage Squad is off on a wild frontier adventure into Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory with a new look team and an awesome line-up of.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250116215300 +0000" stop="20250116224700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>In this episode, the Bodycam Squad come face to face with a crazed axe man who’s smashed a hole in his terrified neighbor's door.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250116224700 +0000" stop="20250116234100 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Firearms officers and a dog unit race to an address in Nottingham where a man is reported to be blockading his family in a house and allegedly making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250116234100 +0000" stop="20250117004000 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>A quad bike crashes with a car and three people are badly hurt.

The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250117215200 +0000" stop="20250117225500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.
