For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250106060000 +0000" stop="20250106070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250106070000 +0000" stop="20250106080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E07 - Episode 7</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250106080000 +0000" stop="20250106090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E09 - Episode 9</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250106090000 +0000" stop="20250106100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.

The boy's captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.  At an agreed upon drop site, FBI agents approach the captor's vehicle, only to watch them flee and quickly be followed by authorities.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250106030000 +0000" stop="20250106040000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the early 90s, Washington, D.C. police were losing the battle against street gangs who enforced their territories with lethal violence.
