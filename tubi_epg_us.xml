New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110062700 +0000" stop="20250110072400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110072400 +0000" stop="20250110082300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Ladies' man Ash needs help covering an embarrassing portrait of his beloved mum.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110082300 +0000" stop="20250110092200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110092200 +0000" stop="20250110102100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110102100 +0000" stop="20250110111800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110111800 +0000" stop="20250110121300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110121300 +0000" stop="20250110130800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The artists cover Zoe's tattoo dedicated to her favourite food, Sean's lewd and lengthy leprechaun that his wife wants rid of.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110130800 +0000" stop="20250110140900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110140900 +0000" stop="20250110150800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110150800 +0000" stop="20250110160900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110160900 +0000" stop="20250110170000 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Firearms officers and a dog unit race to an address in Nottingham where a man is reported to be blockading his family in a house and allegedly making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110170000 +0000" stop="20250110175200 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>In this episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110175200 +0000" stop="20250110184600 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>In this episode, the Bodycam Squad, respond to a burglary and then stumble upon a cannabis growing factory inside a very ordinary looking house.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250110184600 +0000" stop="20250110194000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250111062300 +0000" stop="20250111072600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>At The Glass House in Ambleside, Ramsay finds the restaurant owner close to tears as yet another Saturday night goes tits up.
