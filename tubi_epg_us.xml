The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250117151700 +0000" stop="20250117154300 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250117154300 +0000" stop="20250117160800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250117160800 +0000" stop="20250117163400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250117215200 +0000" stop="20250117225500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250117225500 +0000" stop="20250117235300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is on a back-to-back muddy monster machine SOS in the Northern Territory.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250117235300 +0000" stop="20250118005200 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is on an environmental clean-up mission to remove a toxic rotting vessel that’s trapped on a beach in the Northern Territory.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250118005200 +0000" stop="20250118015000 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Luke Purdy, Jacinta Burns and underground explosive expert and miner Vince venture further off the grid to the Northern Territory.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250118015000 +0000" stop="20250118025200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space;
